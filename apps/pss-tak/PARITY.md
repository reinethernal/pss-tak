# OmniTAK iOS ↔ Android parity tracker

This file lives identically in both [OmniTAK-iOS](https://github.com/engindearing-projects/OmniTAK-iOS) and [OmniTAK-Android](https://github.com/engindearing-projects/OmniTAK-Android). It tracks visual and behavioral gaps between the two clients so they converge on a single OmniTAK design language.

## Design decisions (locked)

These are the architectural calls made up front. Don't reopen them in PRs without raising it as an issue first.

| Decision | Choice | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary navigation** | Bottom tab bar | TAK users are often gloved / one-handed. Matches iTAK convention. Android already there. |
| **Secondary actions** | Long-press radial menu on the map | Already implemented on both platforms; keep it. |
| **Color palette** | Tactical dark by default | Both already lean dark. Extract shared tokens. |
| **License** | Apache-2.0 on both | |

## Open parity gaps

Tracked as a single checklist; tick off when both platforms match. Each item should land as **paired commits** — one PR per repo, referencing the same gap ID.

### P1 — primary navigation
- [x] **GAP-001** iOS: replace hamburger drawer with bottom tab bar (Map / Chat / Servers / Mesh / Settings) — done in `RootTabView.swift`
- [x] **GAP-002** Android: bottom tab bar already in place — keep it
- [x] **GAP-003** Both: identical tab order, labels, icons (SF Symbols ↔ Material icons mapped 1:1)
- [x] **GAP-004** Android: replace flat NavigationBar with floating Liquid Glass capsule matching iOS 26 aesthetic — `LiquidGlassNavBar.kt`. Per-tab brand colors, tinted halo on selection, drop shadow, translucent surface.

### P2 — map basemap
- [x] **GAP-010 (interim)** iOS: default switched from `.satellite` to `.standard` (street map with labels)
- [x] **GAP-010-android-dark** Android basemap upgraded to CartoDB Dark Matter — pure tactical look, both clients now dark by default
- [ ] **GAP-010 (final)** iOS: optional swap MKMapView → MLNMapView to render the same MapLibre style natively. Lower priority now that both look tactical.
- [ ] **GAP-011** Both: provide identical built-in basemap picker (OSM, OpenTopo, Satellite, Dark)
- [ ] **GAP-012** Both: persist last-selected basemap

### P3 — status bar
- [x] **GAP-020** Canonical metric set locked: `dot · server-name · ↓ · ↑ · ±accuracy · time · ☰`
- [x] **GAP-021** iOS adopted text `↓` / `↑` arrows (cyan / orange), matching Android ATAKStatusBar
- [x] **GAP-022** iOS time formatter switched to 24h `HH:mm`
- [x] **GAP-023** Android `±Nm` accuracy badge wired through ATAKStatusBar (stubbed value pending GAP-030b)

### P4 — self-position display
- [x] **GAP-030** PPLI card visible on both — iOS already had it; Android added `SelfPositionCard.kt`
- [x] **GAP-030c** Hide-from-Layers toggle on both. Long-press → Radial → Layers → Callsign Card switch. Mirrors operator complaints that the panel was covering map data.
- [ ] **GAP-030b** Wire real telemetry on Android: FusedLocationProviderClient flow + UserPrefsStore callsign (currently stubbed)
- [ ] **GAP-031** Card position: iOS floats at user location, Android docks bottom-right above bottom nav. Pick one canonical position and align.
- [x] **GAP-032** Android: replaced MapLibre default blue pulse with tactical-accent ATAK bullseye drawable + bearing chevron — `ic_self_marker.xml` / `ic_self_marker_bearing.xml`. iOS still uses MKMapView default blue dot; matching iOS to this style is filed as GAP-032b.
- [x] **GAP-032b** iOS: primary MapViewController delegate now returns a configured MKAnnotationView with `SelfPositionMarkerImage.bullseye` for MKUserLocation. Same hex / proportions as Android `ic_self_marker.xml`. Other map delegates (Map3D, RadialMenuMapOverlay, MeasurementService) still default — adopt later.

### P5 — map controls
- [ ] **GAP-040** Both: same overlay buttons in same positions
- [ ] **GAP-041** Both: scale bar visible by default. iOS already has one; Android needs camera-change listener + meters/pixel calc — deferred.
- [x] **GAP-042** Android: stacked zoom +/− FABs added at BottomStart, paired with locator. `MapControlFab` helper. TacticalMap accepts `zoomInTrigger` / `zoomOutTrigger` Int counters.
- [ ] **GAP-043** Both: locator FAB returns to user position

### P6 — long-press radial menu
- [x] **GAP-050** iOS: RadialMenuView already implemented
- [x] **GAP-051** Android: RadialMenu.kt already implemented
- [ ] **GAP-052** Both: same set of radial actions, same icons, same color tokens

### P7 — design tokens
- [x] **GAP-060** Shared design-tokens spec lives at [DESIGN_TOKENS.md](DESIGN_TOKENS.md) — color palette (surface / brand / affiliation / status / nav-tab tints / text), typography scale, spacing scale, shape radii, elevation tiers. Identical file in both repos.
- [ ] **GAP-061** iOS: extract to `Color+Tactical.swift` referencing DESIGN_TOKENS.md hexes
- [ ] **GAP-062** Android: expand `ui/theme/Color.kt` to cover every DESIGN_TOKENS token
- [ ] **GAP-063** Typography scale extracted into shared types referenced by both

### P8 — onboarding
- [ ] **GAP-070** iOS has FirstTimeOnboarding flow — Android has none, decide if we add it
- [ ] **GAP-071** If yes, identical copy and visuals

### P9 — feature gaps (Android-side)
Features iOS has that Android doesn't yet. Triage which need parity vs which can wait.

- [ ] **GAP-080** Data Package import (.zip) — iOS has, Android missing
- [x] **GAP-081** CSR enrollment (port 8446) — Quick Connect ships in 0.9.0 (vc52)
- [ ] **GAP-082** Video feeds (HLS / RTSP / SRT) — iOS has, Android missing
- [ ] **GAP-083** Photo attachments with EXIF — iOS has, Android missing
- [ ] **GAP-084** Plugin system — iOS has, Android missing
- [ ] **GAP-085** ADS-B traffic display — iOS has, Android has scaffolding (`AdsbService.kt`)

### P10 — feature gaps (iOS-side)
Features Android has that iOS may benefit from. Same triage.

- [ ] **GAP-090** None known yet — to be filled in as discovered

### P11 — Android closed-test feedback (P-E, May 2026)
Real practitioner feedback from Android closed test. Some are bugs to fix, some are features to add. iOS may have the same issues — audit during port.

- [~] **GAP-100** Callsign on main screen stuck at hardcoded `"OMNI-1"` — `MapScreen.kt` was passing a literal string instead of `userPrefs.callsign`. **Code shipped — awaiting SxS verification on emulator before final tick.**
- [~] **GAP-101** Map tile picker (Settings) didn't switch the basemap — `TacticalMap` defaulted to CARTO Dark and `MapScreen` never overrode it. Now wires `MapProvider` enum to a per-provider style JSON (OSM standard / OpenTopoMap / Esri World Imagery / CARTO Dark) and re-applies via `DisposableEffect(styleJson)`. Settings copy updated. **Code shipped — awaiting SxS.**
- [~] **GAP-102** Top-left + top-right hamburger menus on main screen — were wired to empty `Slice 6:` lambdas. Now route via existing `onOpenTab`: server icon → Servers tab; menu icon → Settings tab. **Code shipped — awaiting SxS.**
- [~] **GAP-103** Settings text fields jumpy — DataStore round-trip on every keystroke. Local `mutableStateOf` draft now insulates the field from re-emission; remember-key re-syncs on external changes. Fixed for Callsign (Team is now a dropdown — see GAP-104). **Code shipped — awaiting SxS.**
- [~] **GAP-104** Team field replaced with ATAK standard color dropdown — 14 canonical colors with swatches matching CoT spec (White, Yellow, Orange, Magenta, Red, Maroon, Purple, Dark Blue, Blue, Cyan, Teal, Green, Dark Green, Brown). **Code shipped — awaiting SxS. iOS port pending.**
- [~] **GAP-105** Server auth menu — server icon on the status bar opens Servers tab (GAP-102); Add Server form has username + password; **deep-link import landed** — `atak://`, `omnitak://`, and `https://?host=…` URIs add a server in one tap. Phone QR scanners deep-link into us natively. **Client-cert mTLS landed** — `.p12` picker (Storage Access Framework) + cert password field on the Add Server form; `CertVault` stores PKCS12 bytes under `<filesDir>/tak-certs/`; `TAKConnection.openTlsSocket()` builds a `KeyManager` from the imported cert so `port 8089` mTLS no longer fails with `PEER_DID_NOT_RETURN_A_CERTIFICATE`. Verified against TAK Server 5.7-RELEASE-8 with the `engie-test.p12` cert from `configureInDocker.sh`. Data-package `.zip` handling still deferred. **Code shipped — awaiting SxS.**
- [~] **GAP-105a** Chat send path was throwing `NetworkOnMainThreadException` on every TAK GeoChat send because `TAKConnection.send()` wrote to the socket on the caller thread, not `Dispatchers.IO` as its docstring claimed. Result: every outbound chat marked `failed` even though the server was connected. `send()` is now `suspend` + `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)`, `ServerManager.sendCoT()` is `suspend`, and `ChatScreen.sendChat()` wraps the TAK call in `scope.launch` to mirror the mesh path. Verified end-to-end against TAK 5.7 — message bubble shows `· sent` and TAK Server holds an active subscription. **Shipped.**
- [~] **GAP-106** UTM added to the coordinate-format picker. Display still pending GAP-030b (real position telemetry) — same status as MGRS. **Code shipped — awaiting SxS. iOS port pending.**
- [~] **GAP-107** Custom WMTS basemap — fourth picker option ("Custom") reveals a tile-URL field. Anything XYZ-templated (`https://host/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`) works. Falls back to OSM if blank/invalid. **Code shipped — awaiting SxS.**
- [~] **GAP-109** Meshtastic device settings UI — `MeshDeviceSettingsScreen.kt` reachable via "Device settings" on the Mesh tab. Covers long/short name, role (CLIENT / CLIENT_MUTE / ROUTER / ROUTER_CLIENT / REPEATER / TRACKER / TAK / etc.), PLI broadcast interval (with 15/30/60/120/300 s quick-pick), and primary channel name + LoRa preset (LONG_FAST / LONG_SLOW / etc.). Backed by `MeshDeviceConfigStore` (DataStore-backed draft). iOS parity pending. References: [meshsat-android](https://github.com/cubeos-app/meshsat-android), [columba](https://github.com/torlando-tech/columba). **Code shipped — awaiting SxS.**
- [~] **GAP-109a** Push-to-device write path landed. New `AdminMessageSerializer` hand-rolls the four admin-port submessages we need (`set_owner`, `set_config{device.role}`, `set_config{position.position_broadcast_secs}`, `set_channel{channel0.name}`, `set_config{lora.modem_preset}`) and wraps each in a `ToRadio` with portnum 6 / `want_response = true`. `MeshtasticManager.pushDeviceConfig(...)` dispatches them sequentially over the active TCP or BLE transport and reports how many landed. Settings screen now shows a real **"Push to device"** button when a radio is connected; falls back to the prior copy when offline. Field numbers / enum ordinals taken from the canonical Meshtastic firmware `.proto` set; if upstream reshuffles them we follow. **Code shipped — awaiting SxS.**
- [~] **GAP-110** Several main-screen toggles (Layers panel — callsign card, grid, drawings, aircraft, contacts visibility — and Follow Me) didn't survive a relaunch because they lived in `var ... by remember { mutableStateOf(...) }` instead of DataStore. Six new boolean fields on `UserPrefs`; reads alias from `userPrefs`, writes go through `mutatePref { it.copy(...) }`. **Code shipped — awaiting SxS.**
- [x] **GAP-111** Dead-route audit — every clickable in the UI tree was checked for empty lambdas / TODO callbacks. Clean after GAP-102 wired the only two offenders. No further changes.
- [x] **GAP-112** EUDs rendered as plain blue rectangles with no callsign — `CoTParser` didn't extract `<__group name role>`, and `ContactLayer` used the MapLibre Annotation API (`.title()` = tooltip only) instead of feeding the inline-style `contacts-src` GeoJsonSource. Now parses `__group` into `CoTEvent.teamName/role`, `displayColor` resolves team-name → 14-color TAK palette (overriding affiliation), and `ContactLayer` pushes a FeatureCollection with `color` + `callsign` properties so the existing `contacts-circles` + `contacts-labels` style layers render correctly. PR #49 (closes P-E TAK Discord 2026-05-27 report 1). iOS parity pending. **Shipped — verified on emulator + local TAK 5.7.**
- [x] **GAP-113** Self marker hardcoded blue — `TacticalMap.activateLocation()` registered the LocationComponent bitmap without any team tint. Now reads `UserPrefs.team` and tints the foreground glyph + bearing chevron + pulse + accuracy rings via `TakTeamColor.fromName()` (palette from GAP-112). Settings UI picker tracked separately as #51. PR #53 (closes P-E report 2). iOS parity pending. **Shipped.**
- [x] **GAP-114** Map view reverted to Spokane on every cold start — `MapCameraStore` held the camera in memory only (never serialized). Now persists `lastTargetLat/Lon/Zoom` via DataStore (UserPrefsStore pattern). `MapScreen` cold-start priority is now `persisted → self-fix → FALLBACK_GLOBAL_VIEW (0°N 0°E zoom 2)`; the Spokane hardcode and a stray Cesium Spokane fly-to are both removed. PR #50 (closes P-E report 3). iOS parity pending. **Shipped — verified on emulator.**
- [x] **GAP-115** Chat tab didn't surface contacts that hadn't sent a GeoChat — `ChatScreen.ConversationListView` read only `ChatStore.conversations` (created on incoming `<mesg>` parse). Now merges in every contact from `ContactStore` as a "no messages yet" stub; tapping a stub seeds a full `ChatConversation` (with participant UID + callsign) so the send path resolves correctly on first message. De-duped by UID, own UID excluded. PR #48 (closes P-E report 4). iOS audit pending. **Shipped — verified on emulator (Blue-1 / Orange-1/2/4/7 / Red-1 visible in chat list with "No messages yet" before any chat traffic).**
- [x] **GAP-116** EUDs disappeared after Map→Chat→Map navigation — stale `Marker` refs in the old Annotation-API `ContactLayer.markers` map. Subsumed by GAP-112 architecture overhaul: `ContactStore` is a `StateFlow`, `MapScreen` re-collects with `collectAsState()` on every recompose (so fresh snapshots survive screen lifecycle), `ContactLayer.update()` re-pushes to the new `MapLibreMap`'s `contacts-src` on every style-load. Verified on emulator via logcat — `ContactLayer pushed 12 contacts` continuing through the navigation cycle. No separate PR needed. (closes P-E report 5).
- [x] **GAP-117** Hot regression in v0.33.0 — markers (both PPLI EUDs and locally-dropped markers from the radial menu) silently failed to paint despite `ContactLayer pushed N contacts to contacts-src` showing in logcat. Root cause: GAP-112 routed `setGeoJson(FeatureCollection.fromJson(json))` through the MapLibre Java overload whose null-guard silently no-ops when `features()` is null (Gson `fromJson` can produce this on otherwise-valid input). The native source ended up with zero features so `contacts-circles` had nothing to paint. Fix: call `setGeoJson(String)` directly — goes straight to `nativeSetGeoJsonString`, bypasses the Java guard. Belt-and-suspenders: also install `ContactSymbolLayer` (bitmap `Style.addImage` + `SymbolLayer`, same path `LocationComponent` uses) alongside the inline `contacts-circles` for drivers where `CircleLayer` paint expressions silently fail on the GL fragment pipeline (Adreno 610, SwiftShader). PR #57 / shipped in v0.34.1. **Shipped — verified end-to-end on emulator (red hostile marker visible at Paris drop coords).**

### P13 — Meshtastic depth (best-in-class client)
Goal: become the best Meshtastic client on Android — deeper than the official app for tactical use because every feature lands inside the same TAK-shaped UI. Filed in response to "make this the best Meshtastic client" practitioner ask.

- [~] **GAP-120** Mesh nodes visible on the map — every NodeInfo with a position renders as a contact at the right place; positionless nodes still appear in the node list. **Shipped.**
- [~] **GAP-121** Tappable node detail sheet — long_name, short_name, position (with explicit "no GPS lock yet" copy), SNR, hop distance, battery, last-heard humanized. ModalBottomSheet, reusable for future map-marker tap. **Shipped.**
- [~] **GAP-122** Mesh text chat over portnum-1 (TEXT_MESSAGE_APP). Bidirectional: incoming texts surface as ChatMessages bucketed by `MESH-CH<n>` conversation; outgoing routes through `sendMeshChat()` instead of the TAK CoT GeoChat path when the convo id starts with `MESH-CH`. Primary channel seeded up-front so the Chat tab has a target before any traffic. **Shipped.**
- [~] **GAP-123** Multi-channel awareness — `requestDeviceConfig()` now reads back all 8 Meshtastic channel slots, not just channel 0. Non-disabled slots auto-seed/rename a chat conversation using the operator's actual channel name (eg. "Mesh: Primary" → "Mesh: OmniTAK", or "Mesh: Channel 3" → "Mesh: Local"). Disabled slots stay hidden. `AdminResponse.Channel` now carries the raw role ordinal (0=DISABLED / 1=PRIMARY / 2=SECONDARY) so the consumer can filter without losing data. iOS parity pending. **Shipped.**
- [~] **GAP-124** Mesh direct messages — every node row + the node-detail sheet now have a "Message" action that jumps into the Chat tab on a `MESH-DM-{nodeIdHex}` conversation. RX path detects directed packets (`packet.to == myNodeNum`) and buckets them as DMs (titled "DM: {senderCallsign}") instead of channel chat; broadcast still bucket by channel. TX path sets `MeshPacket.to` to the recipient's nodenum (parsed from the convo id) instead of the broadcast addr. RX echo of our own outgoing sends is skipped via `packet.from == myNodeNum` so the bubble doesn't double-display. Nav route extended to `chat?convoId={...}` so the Mesh tab can pre-select a conversation. iOS parity pending. **Shipped.**

### P12 — Roadmap (bigger asks)
- [ ] **GAP-108** Server-pushed app config / data package settings. Operator pushes settings (PLI intervals, default basemap, server URL, callsign rules) to clients via OpenTAKserver, config file, or `.zip` data package. Real differentiator vs ATAK / iTAK / TAKaware. Source of complaint: 80-node airsoft event needing centralised PLI intervals.
- [ ] **GAP-109b** Meshtastic admin-message acks — surface routing/ack frames from the radio in the UI so the operator sees per-message success or "radio rejected this field". Today `pushDeviceConfig` just reports how many writes landed at the wire layer; whether the radio applied them is invisible until protobuf decode of `FromRadio.routing` ships.

## How to work a parity gap

1. Pick an unchecked GAP that's not blocked by a higher-priority one
2. Open an issue in **both** repos titled `parity: GAP-NNN — short description` and cross-link
3. Implement on the platform that's behind. If both need work, decide source of truth first
4. Open paired PRs. Reference the same GAP ID in both PR titles
5. Both PRs merge together (or close together — within a week)
6. Tick the box in this file in **both repos**
7. Update PARITY.md in the other repo to match
